## Turtle Sim

Since we already learnt the basics, we now learn little bit complex topic.
Here are three progressively deeper projects you can try:

### Publisher–Subscriber Demo (Beginner)
In the beginer project we studied: 

* Create a custom package in C++ or Python.
* Write a publisher node that sends sensor-like data (e.g., temperature).
* Write a subscriber node that listens and logs it.
* This teaches you ROS 2 basics: nodes, topics, messages.

### TurtleSim Controller (Intermediate)

    sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlesim -y

### TODO:

* Write a node that publishes velocity commands to move the turtle in patterns (circle, square).
* Add a subscriber that listens to its pose and adjusts movement.
* This introduces you to services, parameters, and visualization.

### Practise

##### Step 1: Install TurtleSim

Make sure you have it: sudo apt install ros-jazzy-turtlesim -y

##### Run it in one terminal

    ros2 run turtlesim turtlesim_node

#### Create a Workspace & Package

    mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/turtle_sim/src
    cd ~/ros2_ws/turtle_sim
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash

 Or 
    ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python turtle_sim --dependencies rclpy geometry_msgs

Copy turtle_square.py to ../src

colcon build --packages-select turtle_sim --install-base ~/ros2Installs
